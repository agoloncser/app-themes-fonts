# Themes and fonts

[![Main workflow](https://github.com/agoloncser/app-themes-fonts/actions/workflows/bats.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/agoloncser/app-themes-fonts/actions/workflows/bats.yml)

Install my favorite themes and fonts.

## Ubuntu notes

    sudo apt install -y gconf2

Before installing TERMINAL should be set:

    set -xg TERMINAL gnome-terminal

Also the Unnamed theme must be renamed to Default in terminal
